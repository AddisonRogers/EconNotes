## Intro to Microeconomics 
Microeconomics is the study of the economic behaviour of individuals or groups within a society. This can be to do with demand for particular goods in a market or the determination  of wage rates.

## 1.1.1 Economics as a social science
Economics is the scientific study of the ownership, use and exchange of scarce resources. Economics attempts to explain economic behaviour which arises when scarce resources are exchanged. It is argued that economics cannot be a science because it studies human behaviour which cannot be reduced to scientific laws. 
This is why we follow **Ceteris Paribus**. Meaning all other things being equal / remaining constant. 

## 1.1.2 Positive and normative economic statements 
There are different statements economists give: 
A **positive** statement: A statement of fact and can be tested by looking at evidence.
A **normative** statement: A statement that cannot be proved or tested using evidence.

## 1.1.3 The economic problem
The basic economic problem arises because resources are finite but human wants are infinite. This defines scarcity: Multiple parties wanting a good that is not large/plural enough for the demand to be met. These goods can vary between Consumer goods, Capital goods and Renewable or non-renewable ones.
- Consumer goods satisfy wants and needs such as clothes or a car.
- Capital goods are not valued as what they are but rather what they could be used to produce in the future. ie Machinery and Offices.
- Renewable goods are replenished by natural processes and can be practically infinite.
- Non-renewable goods are not replaced naturally and are finite.

#### Opportunity Cost
Opportunity cost measures the value (benefit) of the next best alternative use of the resources foregone.

### Factors of production 
There are 4 types of scarce resource used in the process of production of goods and services. 
	1. **Land and natural resources** includes the land on which production is located and the resources contained within the land. 
	2. **Labour** (human capital) includes the value of human skill and physical effort of people. 
	3. **Capital** includes all man-made goods which help to produce goods and services, such as machinery and equipment. The creation of capital is called *investment*.
	4. **Enterprise** is supplied by the entrepreneur who has the roles of combining the other factors in such a way that the good/service produced will be in the most efficient way and they are also responsible for taking all of the risks associated with the potential loss of assets or commercial losses.

## 1.1.4 Production possibility frontiers
A production possibility frontier shows the ability of a country to make goods and services. It is the easiest way to visualise opportunity cost.

In this case A, B and C are all operating on the borderline at maximum efficiency and it is impossible to produce more goods short-term unless there is less of another ie more wine for less cotton. Long-term however it is possible with growth of human labour and capital.
X here is inefficient. Y is impossible in the short-term.

Some PPFs don't indicate increasing opportunity cost and in those situations the curve is a straight line.  

## 1.1.5 Specialisation
A system of organisation where economic units such as households or nations are not self-sufficient but concentrate on producing certain goods and services and trading the surplus with others. Specialisation by individuals is called the **Division of labour**.
Specialisation by workers where the production of a good is broken up into many separate tasks each performed by one person. 
Specialisation increases labour productivity which is often the hardest thing to increase short-term.

## 1.1.6 Economic systems
### Free market economy
An economic system where resources are allocated by the price mechanism (Demand and supply). The forces of market demand and [[3.6 Government intervention]] determine how resources are allocated. This is known as the working of the price mechanism. Everyone in the market is motivated by self-interest. 

### Command or planned economy 
An economic system where government, through a planning process allocates resources in society. The state allocates workers jobs, decides what gets produced and resource allocates regardless of market prices. 

### Mixed economy 
An economic system where resources are partly allocated by the price mechanism / market and partly by the government / state. Most countries have this system. 
- Markets allocate many resources but governments intervene to different extents in order to ensure a minimum standard of living and to correct market failure. 
- Private sector with private ownership of factors of production, competition, consumers/producers motivated by self-interest 
- Public sector with state owned / run sectors. Resources are allocated through planning process. Governments intervene by raising revenue through taxes and redistributing income in the form of benefits and direct provision of services such as healthcare.

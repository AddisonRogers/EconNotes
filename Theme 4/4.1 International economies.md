## 4.1.1 Globalisation 
[[CC3 Globalisation and FDI - 2020-21.pdf]]
The ever increasing integration of the worlds' local regional and national economies into a single international market. The increasing international interdependence of economic agents.

Globalisation leads to:
1. Increased trade in goods and services
2. The expansion of foreign direct investment (FDI) by trans-national companies.
3. The development of global brands that serve markets in higher  and lower income countries. 
4. Global supply chains. Out-sourcing and off-shoring of production and support services as production supply-chains have become more international. ie the iphone.

A few factors contributing to globalisation in the last 50 years:
1. Trade liberalisation
	- Trade barriers such as tariffs and quotas have been significantly reduced in recent decades especially for manufactured goods.
	- Former communist countries ie China and Russia have joined the global trading system.
	- Global trade agreements have been signed at the WTO
2. Reduced cost of communications
3. Decreased cost of transport
4. Rising skill levels in developing countries 

Benefits of globalisation:
1. Cheap imports
2. Increased exports
3. Increased inward investment 
4. Reduced absolute poverty in developing countries 

Problems of globalisation:
1. Increased foreign competition
2. Increased inequality 
3. Greater macro-economic instability
4. Loss of power of national governments ie tax avoidance, exploitation of works and environment.  

### Foreign direct investment 
The development of multi-national companies has resulted in a huge amount of foreign direct investment in the global economy. FDI is a long-term investment by multi-national companies or governments in other countries. FDI usually occurs in one of two ways:
1. MNCs build new plants or expand their infrastructure in foreign countries.
2. MNCs merge with or acquire existing firms in foreign countries.

FDI can bring benefits of : Economic growth, Jobs, Tax revenue, Improve the current account on the balance of payments


## 4.1.2 Specialisation and trade 
[[CC2 - Specialisation & Trade 2020-21.pdf]]
Countries trade with each other to get a better cost for goods and services or to get goods and services unavailable in their countries.

### Absolute advantage
A country has an absolute advantage over another if it is able to produce a good using fewer resources. 

### Comparative advantage 
A country has a comparative advantage over another if it can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost.

### The exchange rate and PPF
We can illustrate how counties can benefit from trade using diagrams. A production possibility frontier (PPF) can be used to illustrate all possible combinations of goods that can be produced in an economy before trade. A Trading possibility curve (TPC) can be used to represent all the possible combinations of goods that may be consumed if a country specialises and trades.
![[Pasted image 20230116133333.png]]


### Evaluation of comparative advantage 
1. It assumes there are only two countries and two traded goods.
2. It assumes all traded goods are homogeneous
3. It ignores transport costs
4. It assumes there are no barriers to trade 
5. It assumes there are no economies of scale
6. Assumes factors of production can be easily switched from producing one good to another 
7. Ignores external costs 



### Tariff 
A tariff is a tax on imports. The effect of imposing a tariff can be analysed using a diagram. Assumptions however are made when drawing the tariff model.
1. All goods are homogeneous. The wheat produced in the UK is the same as the wheat produced in the rest of the world.
2. The domestic supply curve is upward sloping. As the price of wheat rises in the UK market, UK farmers have the incentive to grow more wheat.
3. The price of imported wheat is determined in the world market. This assumes that the UK is a relatively small part of the world economy. Changes in UK demand or supply have no significant effect on world demand or supply. Therefore, the UK market will not affect the world price. This means that the supply curve of imported wheat is perfectly elastic in the UK market.


### Protectionism
The use of economic policies to regulate trade between countries mainly to reduce imports. 
Protectionism may be used for multiple reasons:
1. To protect employment and incomes. If governments restrict imports this may preserve particular domestic industries and the jobs which they provide. A fall in the value of imports is also likely to cause an increase in aggregate demand and arise in national income.
2. To reduce unfair competition from countries with cheaper labour, lower production standards or who subsidise production.
3. To raise tax revenue.
4. Preserve strategic industries ie defence.
5. Infant industries. Effectively subsidising the price of a developing industry through tariffs until the industry reaches economies of scale.
6. To diversify the economy and avoid dutch disease and primary product dependency. 
7. To prevent dumping. Companies may wish to sell products at a much lower price for various reasons: Surplus production and to kill domestic companies.
8. To correct imbalances of the current account of the balance of payments.
9. To retaliate against restrictions imposed by another country




## 4.1.3 The pattern of trade 
The pattern of trade between countries depends more significantly on comparative advantage than absolute advantage. More developed countries, with bigger stocks of capital and highly skilled labour, might be expected to specialise in high-technology, capital-intensive products. If the pattern of trade matched the pattern of development, the least developed countries might specialise in primary product, while the most developed might trade in services.

## 4.1.4 Terms of trade 
Terms of trade is the ratio of export prices to import prices.
$$
\frac{\text{Index of export prices}}{\text{index of import prices}} \times 100
$$
An improvement in a country's terms of trade implies an increase in its living standards, because less has to be exported to buy a given quantity of imports. However it could also mean that the goods and services are less competitive and so may result in a deterioration in the balance of trade.






## 4.1.5 Trading blocs and the WTO
### Key definitions (3)
- **Bilateral trade agreement**: a trade agreement between two countries to reduce or eliminate tariffs, quotas and other protectionist barriers between themselves.
- **Multilateral trade agreement**: a trade agreement between three or more countries or trading blocs to reduce or eliminate tariffs, quotas and other protectionist barriers between themselves.
- **Preferential trade agreement**: a treaty between two or more countries to lower or abolish some protectionist barriers such as tariffs on trade between members.
- **Trading bloc**: a group of countries which have signed an agreement to reduce or eliminate tariffs, quotas and other protectionist barriers between themselves.
- **Free trade area**: a group of countries between which there is free trade in goods and services where member countries are allowed to set their own level of tariffs against non-member countries. (ie USMCA or ASEAN)
- **Customs union**: a group of countries between which there is free trade in products and which imposes a common external tariff on imported goods from outside the market. (ie Mercosur, CAN)
- **Single market**: a customs union where in addition both labour and capital have freedom of movement within the area and where product standards and laws concerning free movement of goods and services are common between countries. (ie EU)
- **Fiscal union**: a group of countries where a central body has some powers over government borrowing, government spending and setting uniform rates of taxation in member countries.
- **Monetary union**: a group of countries which share a common currency such as the euro. (ie Eurozone)
- **Trade creation**: the switch from purchasing products from a high-cost producer to a low-cost producer.
- **Trade diversion**: the switch from purchasing products from a low-cost producer  to a higher cost producer.

**Trade creation**: A trading bloc may bring benefits from trade creation. Trade creation enables specialisation according to comparative advantage.
**Trade diversion**: A trading bloc could bring disadvantages with trade diversion. As there is a common external tariff imports may no longer be profitable as it once was. 

### The USMCA (NAFTA)
The USMCA is a trade deal designed to reduce the trade deficit of the US. By importing more cars and exporting more dairy to Canada. 

### The European Union 
The EU is a single market consisting of 28 nations. Many of these members are part of the Eurozone too. The EU is a major trading partner across the world and is a major source of inward investment.

#### The benefits and costs of EU membership 
- Exports: There is typically an increase in exports when you join the EU.
- Foreign Direct Investment: The EU gives money to less developed countries to help develop their infrastructure and bring the country up to the EU standard.
- Import prices: If you join the EU import prices decreases a lot due to less tariffs but if you leave then the cost of living may increase.
- Regulations: Joining the EU makes your country agree to the regulations of the EU which can be restrictive. 
- Immigration: Joining the single market may let more labour into the country. 
- Contributions to the EU budget: This is a direct cost to the country's budget. 

### Conflicts between trade blocs and the WTO 
The world trade organisation is a organisation designed to reduce the number of tariffs and trade barriers across the world. Customs unions are directly against this want as they apply a common external tariff, however they do operate as a free trade organisation in a small scale giving inspiration to countries around the world ie africa.

### Exchange rate systems

### Floating 
Where the value of a currency is determined by free market forces with the value of a currency changing from day to day.

### Fixed 
A rate of exchange between at least two currencies, which is constant over a period of time.
Some common examples are:
The gold standard, Currency boards where one currency was pegged against another.

### Managed 
A exchange rate system where free markets determine the value of a currency but where central banks intervene from time to time to change the value of their currency. This is the system that is used today in most economies.
Some common examples of Managed exchange rate systems:
- Adjustable peg system. Where currencies are fixed in value in the short term but devalued or revalued in the long term.
- Bretton woods system. A adjustable peg exchange rate used in post ww2 until the 70s
- Crawling peg system. A adjustable peg system where there is an inbuilt mechanism for regular changes in the central value of the currency.

## 4.1.9 International competitiveness  
A country's international competitiveness refers to its ability to sell its goods and services in domestic and international markets at a **price** and **quality** that is attractive in those markets.

Measures of competitiveness 
- Relative unit labour costs. The measurement of labour costs in one country relative to another.
- Relative export prices. The export prices of a country's goods compared to the export price prices of her main trading partners.
- Quality of goods/services 

Factors influencing international competitiveness 
- Relative unit labour costs and the exchange rate.
- Productivity.
- Regulation.
- Wage and non-wage costs.
- Research and development.
- Quality.
- Taxation.

## Monetary union
A group of countries which share a common currency such as the euro.

The most popular union is the eurozone. Their criteria for joining are:
- Stable prices.
- Stable exchange rate.
- Sound government finances.
- Low interest rates.

As a benefit you get:
- Reduced transaction costs.
- No exchange rate fluctuation.
- Increased price transparency.
- Increased trade between eurozone nations
- Inward investment

As a disadvantage:
- Transition costs.
- Loss of monetary policy independence.
- No exchange rate adjustment possible.
- Constraints on fiscal policy.

### Optimal currency area
A group of countries where efficiency would be maximised by sharing a common currency ie Benelux or the EU

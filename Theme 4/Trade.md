Countries trade with each other to get a better cost for goods and services or to get goods and services unavailable in their countries.

## Absolute advantage
A country has an absolute advantage over another if it is able to produce a good using fewer resources. 

## Comparative advantage 
A country has a comparative advantage over another if it can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost.

## The exchange rate and PPF
We can illustrate how counties can benefit from trade using diagrams. A production possibility frontier (PPF) can be used to illustrate all possible combinations of goods that can be produced in an economy before trade. A Trading possibility curve (TPC) can be used to represent all the possible combinations of goods that may be consumed if a country specialises and trades.

## Evaluation of comparative advantage 
1. It assumes there are only two countries and two traded goods.
2. It assumes all traded goods are homogeneous
3. It ignores transport costs
4. It assumes there are no barriers to trade 
5. It assumes there are no economies of scale
6. Assumes factors of production can be easily switched from producing one good to another 
7. Ignores external costs 



## Tariff 
A tariff is a tax on imports. The effect of imposing a tariff can be analysed using a diagram. Assumptions however are made when drawing the tariff model.
1. All goods are homogeneous. The wheat produced in the UK is the same as the wheat produced in the rest of the world.
2. The domestic supply curve is upward sloping. As the price of wheat rises in the UK market, UK farmers have the incentive to grow more wheat.
3. The price of imported wheat is determined in the world market. This assumes that the UK is a relatively small part of the world economy. Changes in UK demand or supply have no significant effect on world demand or supply. Therefore, the UK market will not affect the world price. This means that the supply curve of imported wheat is perfectly elastic in the UK market.


## Protectionism
The use of economic policies to regulate trade between countries mainly to reduce imports. 
Protectionism may be used for multiple reasons:
1. To protect employment and incomes. If governments restrict imports this may preserve particular domestic industries and the jobs which they provide. A fall in the value of imports is also likely to cause an increase in aggregate demand and arise in national income.
2. To reduce unfair competition from countries with cheaper labour, lower production standards or who subsidise production.
3. To raise tax revenue.
4. Preserve strategic industries ie defence.
5. Infant industries. Effectively subsidising the price of a developing industry through tariffs until the industry reaches economies of scale.
6. To diversify the economy and avoid dutch disease and primary product dependency. 
7. To prevent dumping. Companies may wish to sell products at a much lower price for various reasons: Surplus production and to kill domestic companies.
8. To correct imbalances of the current account of the balance of payments.
9. To retaliate against restrictions imposed by another country

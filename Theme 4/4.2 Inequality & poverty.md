## 4.2.1 Absolute and relative poverty 

### A Distinction between absolute poverty and relative poverty
**Absolute poverty**: When individuals are unable to consume sufficient necessities to survive.
**Relative poverty**: Poor relative to the average individual. 

The groups most likely to be living in poverty are:
- Without employment.
- Low pay.
- Disabilities.
- Young people.
- Homelessness.
- Children.
- Pensioners.
- Women.
- Lower social classes.
- Ethnic minority backgrounds.

### B Measures of absolute poverty and relative poverty 
- Households 60% below average incomes.
- Persistent poverty.
- Absolute low income.
- Real wages

### C Causes of changes in absolute poverty and relative poverty 
- Changes in the rate of economic growth.
- Economic development.
- FDI.
- Increased trade, lower tax, benefits.
- Changes in asset prices.

## 4.2.2 Inequality 

### A Distinction between wealth and income inequality 
**Income** is a flow of money measured over a period of time.
**Wealth** is a stock of assets measured at a point in time.

Wealth tends to be tied to age as when you get older your assets grow in value ie houses. 

### B Measures of income inequality

**Lorenz curve**: a graphical representation of the degree of income or wealth inequality in a society. 
![[Pasted image 20230505102506.png]]
A lorenz curve plot cumulative share of income (or wealth) against the cumulative share of the population with that income / wealth.

**Gini coefficient**: A statistical measure of inequality of income. Its value ranges from 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (highly inequal). The closer the coefficient is to 1, the higher the degree of inequality.

### C Causes of income and wealth inequality within countries and between countries 
- Political stability.
- Education and skills.
- Working culture.
- Geographical location.
- Natural resources.
- Economic system.
- Savings and investment.
- Tax collection.
- Levels of corruption.
- The openness of the economy.
- Resource curse
- Welfare state.
- Primary product dependency.
- Agricultural goods have a low-income elasticity of demand.


### D Impact of economic change and development on inequality 

Kuznets argued that as a country develops and its GDP grows from a subsistence economy, inequality initially increases and then decreases:
- Industrialisation results in increased inequality as workers move from the lower productivity and lower paid agricultural sector into the higher productivity manufacturing sector.
- However, at some point, inequality starts to decrease. This may be because governments have more resources to redistribute income through the tax and benefit system.

### E Significance of capitalism for inequality
A strict definition of capitalism is a society where capital is privately owned, and workers are paid wages by private firms. Essentially it is a society with minimal government intervention and resources are distributed according to the outcome of free markets. This is how inequality is an essential ingredient of capitalism. 
- The basis of capitalism is based off profit motive: an idea of being better off than others.
- Inequality is also important to motivate workers. If all workers got the same wage then no one would work. This leads to inequality in incomes.
- Monopoly power causes inequality as they are able to price customers artificially high prices.
- Inheritance causes inequality as wealth is nepotism based. Causing only the rich to have a lot of money, causing a further uneven playing field when learning and growing more wealth.

## Exchange rate systems

### Floating 
Where the value of a currency is determined by free market forces with the value of a currency changing from day to day.

### Fixed 
A rate of exchange between at least two currencies, which is constant over a period of time.
Some common examples are:
The gold standard, Currency boards where one currency was pegged against another

### Managed 
A exchange rate system where free markets determine the value of a currency but where central banks intervene from time to time to change the value of their currency. This is the system that is used today in most economies.
Some common examples of Managed exchange rate systems:
- Adjustable peg system. Where currencies are fixed in value in the short term but devalued or revalued in the long term.
- Bretton woods system. A adjustable peg exchange rate used in post ww2 until the 70s
- Crawling peg system. A adjustable peg system where there is an inbuilt mechanism for regular changes in the central value of the currency.


# Terms of trade 
Terms of trade is the ratio of export prices to import prices.
$$
\frac{\text{Index of export prices}}{\text{index of import prices}} \times 100
$$
An improvement in a country's terms of trade implies an increase in its living standards, because less has to be exported to buy a given quantity of imports. However it could also mean that the goods and services are less competitive and so may result in a deterioration in the balance of trade.

# International competitiveness competitiveness 
A country's international competitiveness refers to its ability to sell its goods and services in domestic and international markets at a price and quality that is attractive in those markets.

Measures of competitiveness 
- Relative unit labour costs. The measurement of labour costs in one country relative to another.
- Relative export prices. The export prices of a country's goods compared to the export price prices of her main trading partners.
- Quality of goods/services

- Productivity.
- Regulation.
- Wage and non-wage costs.
- Research and development.
- Quality.

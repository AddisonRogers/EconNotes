## Measures of development 
**Economic development is the process of improving the economic wellbeing of a community and raising living standards**.
It measures the quality of growth, rather than merely an increase in incomes. In order to measure the quality of growth, we may take into account access to resources, living standards, the ability to make choices & the sustainability of growth.

Standard of living: The economic well-being of the population including access to necessitates and material goods, income, employment, housing, health, education, safety & environmental quality. 

### Limitations of using GDP as a measure of standard of living 
- GDP figures tell us little about individual people and the quality of their lives.
- GDP figures do not include output from work in the hidden economy.
- Home produced services are not included, subsistence farmers in developing economies, DIY.
- GDP tells us little about sustainability. Development of 'green GDP' useful.
- It is difficult to value the output of the public sector. ie spending on health might be high.
- GDP figures are not as useful as GNP figures which include money flows into and out of the economy.

### The human development index (HDI)
HDI is calculated by the United Nations. It is used as an indicator of the level of development of a country. The HDI was introduced to give a broader definition of well-being than just GDP and provides a composite measure of three basic dimensions of human development. The three dimensions measure:
- Education. The mean years of schooling for an adult aged 25 and expected years of schooling for a pre-school child.
- Health. Life expectancy at birth.
- Income. Real GNI per head at PPPs.

### Other indicators of development 

#### The inequality-adjusted HDI
HDI modified to take account of inequality. 

#### The Multi-dimensional Poverty Index 
Considers multiple deprivations. Ie Child mortality, School attendance, Toilet, Water etc.

## Factors influencing growth and development.

### Infrastructure
The physical capital used for transportation and communication purposes (roads, rails, airways etc), the provision of utilities and public services (ie health and education).
Poor infrastructure can consist of a lack of physical capital.

### Education and skills
Human capital: The productive skills embodied in human beings. Thus education and training constitutes investment in human capital.
Brain drain: The loss of highly productive workers to other countries. In the context of development, this usually entails the migration of educated professionals from developing countries to the developed world.

Education and skills are a key factor in human development. Basic skills such as literacy and numeracy can improve productivity, social mobility and an economy's international competitiveness. But many low income countries such as Sudan does not have the resources to support schools or universities which constraints the economic development in the country.

### Demographic factors
Typical changes in population growth rates over time as a country becomes more developed, due to changes in birth and death rates.

**Dependency ratio** measures the ratio of dependent population to the working age population.

### Volatility of commodity prices

- Commodity markets: These are markets concerned with raw materials, such as precious metals and minerals, and agricultural products.
- Hard commodities: These are natural resources that are mined or extracted.
- Soft commodities: These are agricultural products or livestock. 

Producers of manufactured goods can differentiate their products from those of competitors but commodities tend to be undifferentiated. Most of the time these commodities are a stable price ie gold. But if there is a large crash then a large portion of the economy will tank. Zambia suffered this when Copper dropped to a six and a half year low.

### Primary product dependency 
Primary product dependency is a heavy reliance on a narrow range of products, often commodity products. The commodity/commodities account for: a large % of employment, a large % of GDP and or a large % of exports.

Commodities and natural resources should bring economic growth and development to those countries with abundant natural resources. However, there are a number of reasons why having an abundance of natural resources might lead to a resource curse such as:
- #### Fluctuating commodity prices. 
	Volatile commodity prices can create problems for countries that depend on them.
- #### Dutch disease. 
	The negative impact on a economy due to a sharp inflow of foreign currency causes a currency appreciation making the other products a country makes less price competitive
- #### The Prebisch-Singer hypothesis
	This theory suggests that the terms of trade between primary products and manufactured goods tend to deteriorate over time.

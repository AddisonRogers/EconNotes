## Measures of development 
**Economic development is the process of improving the economic wellbeing of a community and raising living standards**.
It measures the quality of growth, rather than merely an increase in incomes. In order to measure the quality of growth, we may take into account access to resources, living standards, the ability to make choices & the sustainability of growth.

Standard of living: The economic well-being of the population including access to necessitates and material goods, income, employment, housing, health, education, safety & environmental quality. 

### Limitations of using GDP as a measure of standard of living 
- GDP figures tell us little about individual people and the quality of their lives.
- GDP figures do not include output from work in the hidden economy.
- Home produced services are not included, subsistence farmers in developing economies, DIY.
- GDP tells us little about sustainability. Development of 'green GDP' useful.
- It is difficult to value the output of the public sector. ie spending on health might be high.
- GDP figures are not as useful as GNP figures which include money flows into and out of the economy.


### The human development index (HDI)
HDI is calculated by the United Nations. It is used as an indicator of the level of development of a country. The HDI was introduced to give a broader definition of well-being than just GDP and provides a composite measure of three basic dimensions of human development. The three dimensions measure:
- Education. The mean years of schooling for an adult aged 25 and expected years of schooling for a pre-school child.
- Health. Life expectancy at birth.
- Income. Real GNI per head at PPPs.

### Other indicators of development 

#### The inequality-adjusted HDI
HDI modified to take account of inequality. 

#### The Multi-dimensional Poverty Index 
Considers multiple deprivations. Ie Child mortality, School attendance, Toilet, Water etc.

## Factors influencing growth and development.

### Infrastructure
The physical capital used for transportation and communication purposes (roads, rails, airways etc), the provision of utilities and public services (ie health and education).
Poor infrastructure can consist of a lack of physical capital.

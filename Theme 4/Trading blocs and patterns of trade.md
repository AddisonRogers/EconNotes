- **Trade diversion**: the switch from purchasing products from a low-cost producer  to a higher cost producer.

## Benefits and costs of the membership of trade blocs 
**Trade creation**: A trading bloc may bring benefits from trade creation. Trade creation enables specialisation according to comparative advantage.
**Trade diversion**: A trading bloc could bring disadvantages with trade diversion. As there is a common external tariff imports may no longer be profitable as it once was. 

## The USMCA (NAFTA)
The USMCA is a trade deal designed to reduce the trade deficit of the US. By importing more cars and exporting more dairy to Canada. 

## The European Union

## The benefits and costs of EU membership 
- Exports: There is typically an increase in exports when you join the EU.
- Foreign Direct Investment: The EU gives money to less developed countries to help develop their infrastructure and bring the country up to the EU standard.
- Import prices: If you join the EU import prices decreases a lot due to less tariffs but if you leave then the cost of living may increase.
- Regulations: Joining the EU makes your country agree to the regulations of the EU which can be restrictive. 
- Immigration: Joining the single market may let more labour into the country. 
- Contributions to the EU budget: This is a direct cost to the country's budget. 

## Conflicts between trade blocs and the WTO 
The world trade organisation is a organisation designed to reduce the number of tariffs and trade barriers across the world. Customs unions are directly against this want as they apply a common external tariff, however they do operate as a free trade organisation in a small scale giving inspiration to countries around the world ie africa.

## The pattern of trade 
The pattern of trade between countries depends more significantly on comparative advantage than absolute advantage. More developed countries, with bigger stocks of capital and highly skilled labour, might be expected to specialise in high-technology, capital-intensive products. If the pattern of trade matched the pattern of development, the least developed countries might specialise in primary product, while the most developed might trade in services.

## Market-Orientated strategies

### Trade Liberalisation 
If you free up trade between countries then you allow the market to take advantage of specialisation and comparative advantage. This can lead to economies of scale and then export led growth. 
However it does mean that domestic firms may be unable to compete with global competitors and die if there is a lack of subsidies. It does also mean big companies can send profits back to developed countries avoiding tax. Finally the lack of any trade barriers (ie tariffs) can be a loss of revenue for the government.

### Promotion of FDI
### Removal of government subsidies
### Microfinance schemes
### Floating exchange rate systems
### Privatisation

### Development of human capital
### Protectionism 
### Managed exchange rate

## Market-Orientated strategies

### Trade Liberalisation 
If you free up trade between countries then you allow the market to take advantage of specialisation and comparative advantage. This can lead to economies of scale and then export led growth. 
However it does mean that domestic firms may be unable to compete with global competitors and die if there is a lack of subsidies. It does also mean big companies can send profits back to developed countries avoiding tax. Finally the lack of any trade barriers (ie tariffs) can be a loss of revenue for the government.

### Promotion of FDI
FDI may be encouraged by a variety of measures, including, trade liberalisation, deregulation capital markets, tax incentives and measures to make it easier and cheaper for global companies to build factories in developing countries. FDI increases the circular flow of income and is a net inflow on investment. 

### Removal of government subsidies
Subsidies is a grant given which lowers the price of a good, usually designed to encourage production or consumption of a good. Subsidies are often used to target essential goods such as food or fuel to increase the output & investment or just to keep essential goods domestic.

#### Elasticates and subsidies
The more price inelastic is demand or price elastic supply, the more of a subsidy will benefit consumers rather than producers. 

### Microfinance schemes
In developed countries, individuals, firms and governments have access to financial systems allowing them to save, borrow, buy company shares and take out insurance. In many developing countries finance like this is hard to access to many people.

Micro finance is a means of providing extremely poor families with small loans to help them engage in productive  activities or grow businesses. The bulk of the people who take out these loans is self-employed women in rural areas. 

### Floating exchange rate systems
Exchange rates adjust to restore competitiveness. If an economy is uncompetitive the currency will depreciate. This will reduce export prices and increase import prices and increase competitiveness. 

### Privatisation
Governments can raise revenue by selling shares to private individuals. Also, they don't need to subsidise loss making state sector companies. Privatisation may enable governments to introduce more competition in markets and increase contestability. This could increase efficiency and choice as long as there is significant market competition.  

## Interventionist strategies

### Promoting joint ventures with global companies
To avoid some of the disadvantages of FDI, a government of a developing country may insist on a major project being set up as a join venture. 

### Buffer stock schemes
A scheme whereby an organisation buys and sells in the open market so as to maintain minimum and maximum prices in the market for a product. This means that more farmers are willing to get into the market knowing there is stable prices for their goods.

### Development of human capital
If workers have better skills this could increase productivity, AS and economic growth. Development such as education can see rapid economic growth and development however this growth can experience long time lags due to educated children slowly getting into the workforce and can also be subject to a brain drain.

### Protectionism 
The opposite of [[#Trade Liberalisation]]. This means that the government is able to subsidise struggling businesses and also make money off of import and export tariffs.

### Managed exchange rate 
Managed exchange rates can be used to make better export and import deals. This will however mean the economy is less competitive.

### Infrastructure development 
Investment in infrastructure such as roads, railways, power stations and water supplies, schools and hospitals can provide essential services and reduce extreme poverty. This can increase productivity and increase AS and long term economic growth. But this is very expensive to build and there can be a high opportunity cost for developing countries. 

## Other strategies

### Industrialisation: The Lewis Model
The Lewis model is a model in which the economy is split into a rural agricultural sector and an urban industrial sector. Development is promoted by the transfer of surplus labour away from the agricultural sector, attracted by the higher wages available in manufacturing industry. This model argues that workers are unemployed/underemployed in agriculture and that the low productivity is caused by the law of diminishing returns, as each additional worker added to fixed land & capital, marginal product of labour declines.

### Development of tourism
Tourism can be a fast and easy way to develop the economy especially for the increased tax revenues. However tourism is often temporary and can result in seasonal unemployment and also be subject to global changes in the market ie a pandemic. Although tourism can also increase infrastructure in tourist areas this can result in congestion and a lack of infrastructure outside the areas.

### Development of primary industries
Some countries have managed to develop on the basis of primary industries, in which they have a comparative advantage specialising in. Ie Oil, Copper and Sugar. The benefits of developing like this is that it diversifies the economy especially in rural areas. It also means that country is self sustainable and likely to have a stable market due to the inelasticity of food.

### Fairtrade schemes
The aim of fairtrade schemes is to address the injustice of low prices by guaranteeing that producers receive a fair price. These schemes can help develop the community and fair working practices. These increase development by increasing wage which then increases development according to the multiplier effect.

### Aid
A voluntary transfer of resources from one country to another. This can be done in a variety of ways like Grants, Loan, Tied aid, Bilateral aid, Multilateral aid, Official development assistance, Technical assistance and humanitarian aid.

### Debt relief
External debts can act as a severe constraint on growth and development with interest often taking up a large percent of a nation's export revenues. This export revenue takes up a large opportunity cost in developing countries who are unable to grow with the large portion of money leaving the country. 


## Awareness of the role of international institutions and non-government organisations (NGOs)

### World Bank
The world bank was founded after the second world war to promote economic development. It provides low-interest loans, interest free credit and grants to developing countries for education, health and infrastructure. The world bank is mainly used for loans to war devasted countries or underdeveloped ones. However these loans are often tied to structural adjustment programmes (SAPs) which set conditions for the loans to ensure that the debtor pays it back. SAPS were typically based on free market reforms ie trade liberalisation and privatisation, however these were found to increase inequality and caused environmental damage. So they were changed to focus on poverty reduction strategies 

### International Monetary Fund (IMF)
The IMF was set up after WW2 to promote world development and stability. Its specific purpose is to 'promote international monetary co-operation, exchange rate stability and orderly exchange rate arrangements to foster economic growth and high levels of employment and to provide temporary financial assistance to countries to help ease balance of payments adjustment.'
The IMF supports its membership by providing policy advice, Research, Loans, concessional loans and technical assistance.

### NGOs
A non-governmental organisation (NGO) is any non-profit, voluntary citizens' group which is organized on a local, national or international level.

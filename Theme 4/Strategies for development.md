## Market-Orientated strategies

### Trade Liberalisation 
If you free up trade between countries then you allow the market to take advantage of specialisation and comparative advantage. This can lead to economies of scale and then export led growth. 
However it does mean that domestic firms may be unable to compete with global competitors and die if there is a lack of subsidies. It does also mean big companies can send profits back to developed countries avoiding tax. Finally the lack of any trade barriers (ie tariffs) can be a loss of revenue for the government.

### Promotion of FDI
FDI may be encouraged by a variety of measures, including, trade liberalisation, deregulation capital markets, tax incentives and measures to make it easier and cheaper for global companies to build factories in developing countries. FDI increases the circular flow of income and is a net inflow on investment. 

### Removal of government subsidies
Subsidies is a grant given which lowers the price of a good, usually designed to encourage production or consumption of a good. Subsidies are often used to target essential goods such as food or fuel to increase the output & investment or just to keep essential goods domestic.

#### Elasticates and subsidies
The more price inelastic is demand or price elastic supply, the more of a subsidy will benefit consumers rather than producers. 

### Microfinance schemes
In developed countries, individuals, firms and governments have access to financial systems allowing them to save, borrow, buy company shares and take out insurance. In many developing countries finance like this is hard to access to many people.

Micro finance is a means of providing extremely poor families with small loans to help them engage in productive  activities or grow businesses. The bulk of the people who take out these loans is self-employed women in rural areas.

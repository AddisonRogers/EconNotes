## Public Spending
Public spending aka expenditure can vary between:
- Current (day to day spending)
- Capital (long-term investment projects such as hospitals and roads) 
- Transfer payments (Payments from the state with no production in return: child benefit, pensions etc)

### Reasons for public spending 
Public spending may happen for a variety of reasons ie:
- Providing public goods ie defence
- Providing merit goods where external benefits or information failure
- Reduce external costs ie pollution or waste
- Redistribute income 
- Prevent absolute poverty

### Impact of changing levels of public spending 

#### Benefits
- **Welfare benefits** – this spending will help to reduce levels of inequality. For example, benefits to the unemployed enable them to maintain a minimum income and avoid absolute poverty.
    -   There is a potential higher welfare benefit could reduce incentives to work, but on the other hand, welfare benefits can also help the labour market to function more efficiently.
- **Pension spending** – An ageing population, requires higher government spending, – pensions and health care spending. But pension spending has no impact on boosting productivity
- **Education and training** – If successfully targeted on improving skills and education, government spending can increase labour productivity and enable higher long-term economic growth.
- **Infrastructure investment** – Higher spending on roads and railways can help remove supply bottlenecks and enable greater efficiency. This can also boost long-term economic growth.
- **Higher debt interest payments** – If the government has higher debt and higher bond yields, then it can cause increased costs of borrowing. This spending will go to investors and have no benefit for the economy.
- **Military Keynesianism** – an Economic policy based on the position that government should raise Military spending to boost Economic growth.

#### Problems
The potential problems of government borrowing include; **higher debt interest payments, a need to raise taxes in the future, crowding out of the private sector and – in some cases – inflationary pressures**.

## Taxation
Taxation is for paying government expenditure, managing/correcting the economy, redistributing income. 

### Types of taxation
- Direct taxes: Direct taxation is levied on income, wealth and profit. ie Income tax.
- Indirect taxes: Indirect taxes are levied on spending by consumers on goods and services ie VAT.
- Progressive taxes: As income rises, a larger percent of income is paid in tax. ie Income tax.
- Proportional taxes: The percent of income paid in tax is constant, no matter what the level of income.
- Regressive taxes: As income rises, a smaller percentage of income is paid in tax ie alcohol. 

The main taxes in the UK are: Income tax, National insurance contributions, Corporation tax, Capital gains tax, Inheritance tax, Excise duties, Value added tax, Council tax, Business rates.

### Impact of Direct taxes
Finding the optimal level of direct taxation is difficult. You don't want it to dissuade further increases in salary. The *laffer curve* was made because of this difficulty.

The impact of the laffer curve says that as the tax rate increases past T there will be a fall in tax revenue.

### Impact of Indirect taxes 
Indirect taxes generally hit the poorer population more than direct taxes. An increase in VAT for example also has the side problem of decreasing consumption. This can affect businesses.

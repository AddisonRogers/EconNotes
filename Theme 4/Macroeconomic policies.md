## Public Spending
Public spending aka expenditure can vary between:
- Current (day to day spending)
- Capital (long-term investment projects such as hospitals and roads) 
- Transfer payments (Payments from the state with no production in return: child benefit, pensions etc)

### Reasons for public spending 
Public spending may happen for a variety of reasons ie:
- Providing public goods ie defence
- Providing merit goods where external benefits or information failure
- Reduce external costs ie pollution or waste
- Redistribute income 
- Prevent absolute poverty

### Impact of changing levels of public spending 

#### Benefits
- **Welfare benefits** – this spending will help to reduce levels of inequality. For example, benefits to the unemployed enable them to maintain a minimum income and avoid absolute poverty.
    -   There is a potential higher welfare benefit could reduce incentives to work, but on the other hand, welfare benefits can also help the labour market to function more efficiently.
- **Pension spending** – An ageing population, requires higher government spending, – pensions and health care spending. But pension spending has no impact on boosting productivity
- **Education and training** – If successfully targeted on improving skills and education, government spending can increase labour productivity and enable higher long-term economic growth.
- **Infrastructure investment** – Higher spending on roads and railways can help remove supply bottlenecks and enable greater efficiency. This can also boost long-term economic growth.
- **Higher debt interest payments** – If the government has higher debt and higher bond yields, then it can cause increased costs of borrowing. This spending will go to investors and have no benefit for the economy.
- **Military Keynesianism** – an Economic policy based on the position that government should raise Military spending to boost Economic growth.

#### Problems
The potential problems of government borrowing include; **higher debt interest payments, a need to raise taxes in the future, crowding out of the private sector and – in some cases – inflationary pressures**.

## Taxation
Taxation is for paying government expenditure, managing/correcting the economy, redistributing income. 

### Types of taxation
- Direct taxes: Direct taxation is levied on income, wealth and profit. ie Income tax.
- Indirect taxes: Indirect taxes are levied on spending by consumers on goods and services ie VAT.
- Progressive taxes: As income rises, a larger percent of income is paid in tax. ie Income tax.
- Proportional taxes: The percent of income paid in tax is constant, no matter what the level of income.
- Regressive taxes: As income rises, a smaller percentage of income is paid in tax ie alcohol. 

The main taxes in the UK are: Income tax, National insurance contributions, Corporation tax, Capital gains tax, Inheritance tax, Excise duties, Value added tax, Council tax, Business rates.

### Impact of Direct taxes
Finding the optimal level of direct taxation is difficult. You don't want it to dissuade further increases in salary. The *laffer curve* was made because of this difficulty.

The impact of the laffer curve says that as the tax rate increases past T there will be a fall in tax revenue.

### Impact of Indirect taxes 
Indirect taxes generally hit the poorer population more than direct taxes. An increase in VAT for example also has the side problem of decreasing consumption. This can affect businesses.

## Budget deficits and the national debt
Fiscal policy is the use of taxation, government spending and government borrowing. 
A fiscal deficit or budget deficit is where a government spends more than they receive in revenue in one year. The government must therefore borrow to finance their spending.
The national debt is the total accumulated government debt over time. If the government has a budget deficit the national debt will rise. 
A fiscal surplus or budget surplus is where a government receives more in tax revenue than they spend in one year. The government could choose to reduce the national debt or they could cut taxes or raise government spending.


## Automatic and discretionary fiscal policy 
**Automatic stabilisers**: a process by which government expenditure and tax revenue varies with the business cycle, thereby helping to stabilise the economy without any conscious intervention from government. 

### Discretionary fiscal policy 
**Demand management**: Government use of fiscal or other policies to manipulate the level of aggregate demand in the economy. 
**Active or discretionary fiscal policy**: The deliberate manipulation of government expenditure and taxes to influence the economy.
**Expansionary fiscal policy**: Fiscal policy used to increase aggregate demand.
**Budget deficit**: A deficit which arises because government spending is greater than its tax receipts. The government therefore has to borrow money to finance the difference.
**Contractionary fiscal policy** or tighter fiscal policy: used to reduce aggregate demand.
**Budget surplus**: a government surplus arising from government spending being less than its tax receipts.
**Fiscal austerity**: tax rises or government spending cuts designed to reduce a government budget deficit.

## Structural and cyclical deficits 
**Cyclical deficit**: That part of the fiscal deficit which is caused by government spending and taxes changing through the trade cycle.
**Structural deficit**: That part of a fiscal deficit that exists even when the cyclical deficit is zero at the top of a boom.
**Primary deficit or surplus**: The actual fiscal deficit or surplus not taking into account interest payments on the national debt.
**Current budget deficit**: occurs when government revenues are less than current expenditure. It does not include government capital expenditure.

A cyclical fiscal deficit occurs during a downturn in the economy because tax revenues will be falling and government expenditure will be increasing. A structural fiscal deficit however remains even when the economy is operating at its full potential. 


## Costs and benefits of large budget deficits/national debts
Costs:
- Opportunity cost of increased debt repayments. 
- Confidence of financial markets. -> May lose confidence in the bond market. 
- Crowding out:
	- Resource crowding out. -> less labour and capital for work.
	- Financial crowding out. -> increased loans may cause higher interest rates -> increased interest rates cause less money available for entrepenurs  


## Monetary policy revision
### The monetary policy committee (MPC)
- The MPC meets at the bank of england. It is chaired by the Governor of the Bank. There are 9 members in total, 5 from the bank and 4 independent experts.
- The MPC meets monthly to decide on the Bank Rate and the amount of QE.
- The MPC is responsible for meeting the government's inflation target.
- The MPC publishes the minutes of its meetings (8 times a year) and if the inflation target of 2% is missed the Governor must send an open letter to the Chancellor.

### The Bank's remit and the inflation target 
- The inflation target is 2% CPI inflation. The target is announced each year in the Budget.
- Although the Bank has independence, in extreme circumstances the Government could instruct the Bank for a limited period.
- The target is not the lowest possible rate of inflation. Inflation below the target is considered to be undesirable.
- If the target is missed by more than 1% then the Governor has to write a open letter to the Chancellor.
- It is recognised that it is very unlikely that inflation will be 2% all the time.

## 3.5.1 Demand for labour
The demand for labour is the number of workers that firms are willing and able to hire in a particular job or industry for a given wage.

### 3.5.1 (A) Factors that influence the demand for labour
- Movements up and down the labour demand curve - caused by changes in real wage rate only. Higher real wages increase costs of production and reduces the profit from each unit produced - firms may substitute away from labour and into more capital-intensive processes, and vice versa. 
- Shifts can also be caused by:
	- Demand for the product being produced.
	- Productivity of the labour. // Marginal labour product theory
	- Employment subsidy.
	- Changes in technology.

### 3.5.1 (B) Demand for labour as a derived demand
The demand for all factors of production is *derived* from the demand for the products produced by them. 
- In a growing economy the total demand for labour will rise as AD rises.
- In a recession the total demand for labour will fall as AD falls.
- If demand for a product is rising, the workers with relevant skills will be in greater demand. 
- In declining industries the demand for labour will fall. 

### Elasticity of demand for labour
Elasticity of demand for labour is the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of labour to changes in the real wage rate. 
$$ 
\frac{\%\Delta \text{QD}}{\%\Delta \text{RWR}} 
% / % \Delta of RWR 
$$
- Labour costs as a proportion of total costs.
- The east of substituting other factors for labour.
- PED of product being produced.
- Time

## 3.5.2 Supply of labour
The supply of labour is the number of workers willing and able to work in a particular job or industry for a given wage.
![[Pasted image 20230428152138.png]]

### 3.5.2 (A) Factors that influence the supply of labour
- Movements up and down ie the higher the wage offered the more people will want to do that job.
- Other:
	- Substitute occupations.
	- Barriers to entry.
	- Non-monetary characteristics.
	- Net migration of labour.
	- Retirement age.
	- Income tax rates.
	
### Elasticity of supply of labour
Elasticity of supply of labour is a measure of the responsiveness of the quantity supplied of labour to changes in the real wage rate (RWR)
$$ 
\frac{\%\Delta \text{QS}}{\%\Delta \text{RWR}} 
% / % \Delta of RWR 
$$

#### Determinants of elasticity of supply of labour to an industry
1. Degree of skill needed 
![[Pasted image 20230428153202.png]]
2. Amount of training required / ease of entry 
3. Time
4. Extent of unemployment and underemployment in the economy
5. Occupational and geographical mobility.

### 3.5.2 (B) Market failure in labour markets - immobility of labour 
**Geographical** immobility refers to the inability of workers to move to different places to seek and find work. This can be from: 
- Family and social ties.
- Financial costs in moving.
- Job search costs.
- House prices.
- Renting cost.
- General cost of living between regions.
- Migration controls.
- Cultural and language barriers.

**Occupational** immobility refers to the inability of workers to move between jobs as they lack appropriate skills, qualifications or training. This can be from:
- Lack of appropriate skills of those unemployed to move into job vacancies.
- Low levels of transferable skills.
- Structural unemployment causes by decline of industries.

**Market failure** will mean job vacancies exist in some areas while there is unemployment in other areas. 

## 3.5.3 (A) Wage determination in competitive and non-competitive labour markets
### 3.5.3 (A) Competitive labour markets 
In a competitive labour market wages are determined by the demand for labour and the supply of labour. Under the assumptions of:
- Freedom of entry to labour market.
- Perfect knowledge.
- Firms are 'Wage takers'.
- Homogeneous labour.
![[Pasted image 20230502093451.png]]

In the real world wage rates differ because labour is not homogeneous. Workers differ by the degree of human capital they have as well as by ability. Factors causing differences in wages include:
- Elasticity of demand and supply of labour.
- Differing demand for labour.
- Differing levels of supply of labour.
- Compensatory reasons - skills/qualifications/experience/region/productivity/age.
- Hours worked (social/unsocial).
- Public versus private sector workers.
- Problem of a monopsony employer for certain workers.
- Impact of trade union membership.
- Impact of immobility of labour.
- Level of responsibility.
- Impact of discrimination. 
- Gender pay gap.
- Current labour market issues.

### 3.5.3 (A) non-competitive labour markets
1. Monopoly BUYER of labour (monopsonist)
	If a firm/employer is the only buyer of a certain type of labour it can use its market power to force down wages. The marginal cost of employing one more worker is higher than average wage. 
![[Pasted image 20230428160236.png]] 
2. Monopoly SELLER of labour (trade union)
	A trade union is an organised association of workers in a a trade or profession which is formed to promote the interests of workers.
3. Bilateral monopoly
	If a trade union operates in a monopsony labour market then the only buyer is facing the only seller of labour. 

## 3.5.3 (B) Current labour market issues - migration, skills, productivity
### 1. Migration 
The impact of immigration is to increase the labour force. There are potential effects on employment, unemployment and wages.

### 2. Skills shortage
The government produces a 'short occupation list' which provides information for employers of recruiting migrant workers under the points-based system for issuing visas. 

### 3. Low productivity 
Labour productivity is output per worker for period of time. For many years UK productivity has been lower than that of other industrialised countries. UK productivity has also been very slow to recover since the financial crisis. 

### 4. Gender pay gap 
The gender pay gap is calculated as the difference between average hourly earnings (excluding overtime) of men and women as a proportion of average hourly earnings (excluding overtime) of men's earnings.
### 5. Gig economy 
A gig economy is where workers are paid for the gigs they do ie food delivery or a car journey. 
## 3.5.3 (C) Government intervention in labour markets 

### Maximum wages
Governments are less likely to impose minimum wages. However some forms of maximum wage limits have been set in the past:
- Maximum pay rises were set by the UK government in the 1970s.
- Maximum reward for chief executives of companies. 
![[Pasted image 20230502102306.png]]

### Minimum wages
A statutory minimum wage is the legal minimum rate per hour which employers must pay their workers.  
![[Pasted image 20230502102409.png]]
*Low* pay is more likely for:
- Temporary workers rather than permanent workers.
- Private sector rather than public sector workers. 
- Workers employed by small firms rather than large firms. 
- Newly employed workers.
- Those working in occupations with low average earnings. 
- Those working in industries with low average earnings.

If the minimum wage is set above the equilibrium wage rate it will cause an excess supply of labour and therefore create unemployment. 

#### The living wage
The concept of a living wage is one which would provide a reasonable standard of living and enable a person to live debt-free. The thought behind this is that if you increase the wage for jobs then you will also increase productivity. 

### Public sector wage determination 
The government is a significant employer in the UK, although it has declined since 2010.
![[Pasted image 20230503143928.png]]

- The government has significant influence over wages for public sector workers and for many employees acts as a monopsony employer. 
- Where trade unions represent public sector workers there will be a process of collective bargaining with resulting pay depending on the relative strength of the trade unions and the monopsony power of the government.
- Where trade unions are weak wages will be lower.
- There was a public sector pay freeze from 2010 to 2015.
- In the UK there is little difference between private and public sector pay when all factors are taken into account such as levels of skill.
- In some developing countries public sector jobs are highly prized as the wages are higher than the private sector.

### Policies to tackle labour market immobility 
- Improving education and training to incorporate more transferable skills. (Occupational)
- Improving information about job vacancies. (Occupational)
- Better transport infrastructure. (Geographical)
- Relocation subsidies. (Geographical)
- Provision of low cost housing. (Geographical)
- Reducing discrimination in the labour market. (Occupational)
- Subsidising firms to locate in areas of high unemployment. (Occupational)
- Reducing barriers to entering occupations. (Occupational)

### Marginal productivity theory
We assume firms aim to maximise profits. In a goods market this means producing up to the point where MC = MR.
In the labour market the firm will maximise profits where the marginal cost of employing one more worker is equal to the marginal revenue from the output of the last worker.
**Marginal revenue product**: The marginal revenue product is the addition to total revenue from the last worker employed. 

Assumptions:
- Workers are homogeneous.
- Firms have no buying power when demanding labour.
- There are no trade unions.
- The productivity of each worker can be easily measured.
- The supply of labour is perfectly elastic.
- The product is sold in a perfectly competitive market.

![[Pasted image 20230505092705.png]]

In many cases it is hard to measure labour productivity - if there is no physical output. In many cases wages are set with not consideration of demand for labour. It is useful as a model of the demand for labour in many cases, but to analyse wage differentials, supply side information is needed too.

The characteristics of a market, which determine firms' behaviour.

| Revenue         | Description                                                            | Equation                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Total revenue   | The total money received from the sale of any given quantity of output | TR = price per unit x quantity sold |
| Average revenue | The average receipts per unit sold                                     | AR = TR/Q                           |
| Marginal revenue | The change in revenue from selling one extra unit of output.           | MR = change in TR / change in quantity |

There are a few characteristics for each market structure:
- Number of firms in the market.
- Barriers to entry.
- Barriers to exit.
- Homogeneous/Heterogeneous goods.
- Brand.
- Information in the market.
- Interdependence.

### Barriers to entry
Barriers to entry are factors which make it difficult or impossible for firms to enter an industry and compete with existing producers.

### Barriers to exit
These barriers are obstacles to firms leaving the market. This is likely sunk costs or reputation damage. 

### Price takers and price makers
A price taker is a firm which has no influence on the market price and must sell all its output at the going market price. Firms in a perfectly competitive market are price takers.
A price maker is a firm which is able to select the price a which it sells it output. It will generally sell more at a lower price. There are differing degrees of price-setting power. A monopolist has the most power to set price as its is the only firm in the market. In oligopoly and monopolistic competition firms have less price-setting power but can still raise their price without losing all their customers.


## 3.4.1 Efficiency
There are a few types of efficiency:
- Allocative efficiency is achieved when the value consumers place on a good or service equals the cost of the resources used up in production.
- Productive efficiency is achieved when the output is produced at minimum average total cost.
- Dynamic efficiency is when resources are allocated efficiently over time. 
- X-inefficiency occurs when a firm has little incentive to control costs due to large profits being earned and a lack of competition. 


## 3.4.2 Perfect competition
This is when there is many buyers and sellers the market with perfect knowledge to produce homogeneous goods with no barriers to exit or entry. 
Perfect competition is impossible due to the impossibility of these factors.
A few markets close to this are:
- Agriculture.
- Foreign exchange markets.

Implications of this model are that firms are price takers and sell as much as they wish at the ruling market price. 



## 3.4.3 Monopolistic competition.
A market structure where a large number of small firms produce differentiated products and where there are low barriers to entry or exit.
In this structure buyers and sellers can relatively easily leave and sell a variety of goods with perfect knowledge. 
## 3.4.4 Oligopoly

**Oligopoly: a market where a small number of interdependent firms compete with each other.**
Oligopolistic markets are typically characterised by a few things:
- Oligopoly is dominated by a **few firms** with a **high concentration ratio**. 
- Firms are **interdependent** when the actions of one firm will have an impact on other firms, a firm's decisions on price, output and other competitive activities may have immediate effects upon other competitors. 
- This means that **each firm must react to rivals decisions and try to anticipate their future actions**. Firms must deal with uncertainty. 
- Oligopoly is also defined by the **high barriers to entry and exit**. Factors which make it difficult or impossible for firms to enter or exit an industry and compete with existing firms. Therefore supernormal profits can remain.
- **Product differentiation**: goods or services distinguish one product from another such as product formulation, packaging, marketing or availability. 
- **Price stability**: Prices in oligopolistic markets seem to change far less than in perfectly competitive markets, even when costs change.
- **Predatory pricing**: an anti-competitive strategy in which a firm sets price below average variable cost in an attempt to force a rival or rivals out of the market and achieve market dominance.
- **Limit pricing**: When a firm, rather than short run profit maximising, sets a low enough price to deter new entrants from coming into its market.
- **Price war**: A situation where several firms in a market repeatedly lower their prices to outcompete other firms; the objective may be to gain or defend market share. To avoid price wars, non-price competition is often preferred.
- **Non-price competition**: Is all forms of competitive action other than through the price mechanism. 

### B Market Concentration
The degree to which the output of an industry is dominated by its largest producers.
It can be measured by the market share of each company, which is the proportion of sales in a market taken by a firm or a group of firms. 
The concentration ratio is the combined market share of the x largest firms in the industry. If the ratio is high, the market is described as highly concentrated. Market concentration can depend on how widely or narrowly a market is defined, if a market is defined more narrowly, then there are likely to be fewer producers.

### C Non-collusive oligopoly 
Non-collusive oligopolies are when firms in a oligopolistic industry compete amongst themselves and there is no collusion. 

### Kinked demand curve theory
The theory that oligopolists face a demand curve that is kinked at the current price, demand being significantly more elastic above the current price than below. The effect of this is to create a situation of price stability. 
![[Pasted image 20230316002401.png]]
The issues with this theory are:
- Initial price/output not explained.
- Competitive oligopolists seldom respond to price changes in the manner assumed in the theory.
- In a buoyant market firms may follow price rises.
- Research shows oligopoly prices tend to be stable when demand conditions change in predictable/cyclical way but oligopolists raise/lower prices quickly and by significant amounts when production costs change substantially and when unexpected shifts in demand.
- A doubtful model but it does illustrate how oligopolists are interdependent and are affected by **uncertainty** 

### D Collusion and cartels
Collusion is collective agreements between producers which restrict competition. A collusive oligopoly is when firms in a oligopolistic industry form a cartel and collude, typically to restrict output and raise prices and profits. Collusion can happen in a variety of different ways:
- [[#Cartel]]: An agreement between firms on price and output with the intention of maximising their joint profits 
- Overt (or formal) Collusion: When firms make agreements among themselves to restrict competition. Typically by reducing output, raising prices and keeping potential competitors out of the market. Overt collusion suggests communication has taken place between the firms.
- Tacit (or informal) Collusion: When firms co-operate without any formal agreement having been reached or even without any explicit communication between the firms having taken place. Firms monitor each other's behaviour closely, unwritten rules developed which define ways in which firms may or may not compete. [Trust](https://ncase.me/trust/ "https://ncase.me/trust/") is required.
- Although less collusion-y **Price leadership** can occur. This is when one firm (The leader) sets its own prices and other firms simply follow and set their prices in relation to the price leader.

#### Cartel
Cartel agreements are usually secret, verbal and often informal. Typically cartels may agree on price, output levels, discounts, credit terms, territory, customer base, bid rigging. These agreements are prohibited and any business found to be a member of a cartel can be fined up to 10% of its worldwide turnover.  

### E Game theory 
The analysis of situations in which players are interdependent. 
Assuming there is no formal collusion: All firms are interdependent and must take account of the reactions of one another when forming a market strategy and are independent in the sense that they have to decide their strategies without co-operation or collusion ie incomplete information. This means that firms must attempt to predict what other firms will do. 

#### Prisoners' dilemma
> The prisoner's dilemma is a thought experiment that challenges two completely rational agents to a dilemma: they can cooperate with their partner for mutual benefit or betray their partner ("defect") for individual reward.
>
> A: If A and B both remain silent, they will each serve the lesser charge of 2 years in prison.
>
> B: If A betrays B but B remains silent, A will be set free while B serves 10 years in prison.
>
> C: If A remains silent but B betrays A, A will serve 10 years in prison and B will be set free.
>
> D: If A and B both betray the other, they share the sentence and serve 5 years.

This is the Payoff matrix showing the outcomes of the game.
![[Drawing 2023-03-16 01.02.50.excalidraw]]

There are different strategies for game theory:
- MAXMIN: The worst outcome is the least bad (most cautious) so it would be telling.
- MAXIMAX: The better outcome is the best out of the decisions (most optimistic) so it would be to tell.
- Dominant: The choice that both the MAXIMAX and the MAXMIN strategies calls for.


#### 
Game theory seeks to analyse strategic behaviour of and between firms, it illustrates the interdependence between firms. 
Simple game theory assumes that both players act simultaneously however in reality one player may move first. 

#### First mover's advantage
A form of competitive advantage that a company earns by being the first to enter a specific market or industry. Being the first allows a company to acquire superior brand recognition and customer loyalty. The company also has more time to perfect its product or service. The first-mover advantage refers to the first significant company to move into a market, not merely the first company. First-mover advantage can be instrumental in building market share, but this may or may not lead to business success. Basically, being a first-mover only makes sense if the rewards justify the risks. Some industries reward first-movers with near-monopoly status and high margins. first-mover status is never a strategy as itself but rather a prelude to a larger plan. 

### Pricing and non-pricing strategies 

#### F Pricing strategy 
1. Predatory pricing: An anti-competitive strategy in which a firm sets price below average variable cost in an attempt to force a rival or rivals out of the market and achieve market dominance.
2. Limit pricing: When a firm, rather than short run profit maximising, sets a low enough price to deter new entrants from coming into its market.
3. Price wars: When several firms in a market repeatedly lower their prices to outcompete other firms to defend or gain market share. However sometimes price wars are used in a similar way to predatory pricing.
4. Price discrimination: charging a different price for the same good or service in different markets.

#### G Non-pricing strategy 
1.  Branding: name/design/symbol which distinguishes product from other similar products, supported by advertising and packaging. Also brand loyalty.
2. Advertising.
3. New product development: investment in research and development.
4. New production methods: investment in new technology to improve efficiency.
5. Product/service quality and differentiation: Quality ingredients and otherwise increasing the non-value value of your product to the customer.
6. Mergers/takeovers
7. Collusion.

#### Other strategies 
1. Penetration pricing: Setting a low initial entry price to attract new customers and encourage customers to switch to the new brand.
2. Price skimming: setting a high price before other competitors enter the market. ie early adoption tax
3. Cost-plus pricing: Fixing a price for their products by adding a fixed percentage profit margin to the long-run average cost of production.
4. Product line pricing: When you have more than one product in a line. ie printers and ink or razer and blades.

## 3.4.5 Monopoly 
A market structure where one firm supplies *all* output in the industry without facing competition because of high barriers to entry to the industry.
A working monopoly is where a firm has a market share of 25%
A dominant monopoly is where a firm has a market share of >=40% 

Monopoly power is the ability to influence the market. 
Natural monopoly is an industry where a substantial economies of scale is required to be viable. 

### Evaluation of monopoly : Costs 
1. Loss of economic efficiency.
2. Welfare loss, higher prices and lower output.
3. Redistributive effect.
4. Less consumer choice.

### Evaluation of monopoly : Benefits
1. Possible improvement in dynamic efficiency.
    - Schumpeter and 'creative destruction'
	Schumpeter considered that monopoly leads to the development of new products as firms need to get round barriers to entry. They create products to destroy the monopoly position of existing products.
2. Global competition.
3. Economies of scale.
4. Cross-subsidisation.
	This can be used to avoid price discrimination. ie it costs more money to ship mail across the country than next door but the post office costs the same price.

## 3.4.7 Contestability 
A contestable market is a market with low entry/exit barriers, perfect knowledge and low brand loyalty. The best example for these markets are hair dressers or low level takeout. 
This model predicts that supernormal profits will be made in the short run. Causing other firms to compete as long as exit costs are low. This can often lead to hit-and-run competition where a firm enters the market to take advantage of temporarily high profits before leaving. The threat of this causes established firms to keep prices down and only make normal profit in the short run. 
This drive to keep prices down causes firms to produce efficiently as possible. Long run firms will operate at bottom of average cost curve ie MC = AC being productively efficient. As they can only earn normal profit in the long run AR = AC. Therefore AR = MC which indicates allocative efficiency.

### Affect on government policy
Previously monopoly power defined by number of firms in the market and the concentration ratios. Policy makers had to take a interventionist approach to control monopoly power. However by using contestable market theory, monopolies are justified and government would rather take a free market approach and remove further barriers to entry/exit.

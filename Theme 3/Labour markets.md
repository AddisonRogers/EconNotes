## 3.5.1 Demand for labour
The demand for labour is the number of workers that firms are willing and able to hire in a particular job or industry for a given wage.

### 3.5.1 (A) Factors that influence the demand for labour
- Movements up and down the labour demand curve - caused by changes in real wage rate only. Higher real wages increase costs of production and reduces the profit from each unit produced - firms may substitute away from labour and into more capital-intensive processes, and vice versa. 
- Shifts can also be caused by:
	- Demand for the product being produced.
	- Productivity of the labour. // Marginal labour product theory
	- Employment subsidy.
	- Changes in technology.

### 3.5.1 (B) Demand for labour as a derived demand
The demand for all factors of production is *derived* from the demand for the products produced by them. 
- In a growing economy the total demand for labour will rise as AD rises.
- In a recession the total demand for labour will fall as AD falls.
- If demand for a product is rising, the workers with relevant skills will be in greater demand. 
- In declining industries the demand for labour will fall. 

### Elasticity of demand for labour
Elasticity of demand for labour is the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of labour to changes in the real wage rate. 
$$ 
\frac{\%\Delta \text{QD}}{\%\Delta \text{RWR}} 
% / % \Delta of RWR 
$$
- Labour costs as a proportion of total costs.
- The east of substituting other factors for labour.
- PED of product being produced.
- Time

## 3.5.2 Supply of labour
The supply of labour is the number of workers willing and able to work in a particular job or industry for a given wage.

### 3.5.2 (A) Factors that influence the supply of labour
- Movements up and down ie the higher the wage offered the more people will want to do that job.
- Other:
	- Substitute occupations.
	- Barriers to entry.
	- Non-monetary characteristics.
	- Net migration of labour.
	- Retirement age.
	- Income tax rates.
	
### Elasticity of supply of labour
Elasticity of supply of labour is a measure of the responsiveness of the quantity supplied of labour to changes in the real wage rate (RWR)
$$ 
\frac{\%\Delta \text{QS}}{\%\Delta \text{RWR}} 
% / % \Delta of RWR 
$$

#### Determinants of elasticity of supply of labour to an industry
1. Degree of skill needed 
![[Pasted image 20230428153202.png]]
2. Amount of training required / ease of entry 
3. Time
4. Extent of unemployment and underemployment in the economy
5. Occupational and geographical mobility.

### 3.5.2 (B) Market failure in labour markets - immobility of labour 
**Geographical** immobility refers to the inability of workers to move to different places to seek and find work. This can be from: 
- Family and social ties.
- Financial costs in moving.
- Job search costs.
- House prices.
- Renting cost.
- General cost of living between regions.
- Migration controls.
- Cultural and language barriers.

**Occupational** immobility refers to the inability of workers to move between jobs as they lack appropriate skills, qualifications or training. This can be from:
- Lack of appropriate skills of those unemployed to move into job vacancies.
- Low levels of transferable skills.
- Structural unemployment causes by decline of industries.

**Market failure** will mean job vacancies exist in some areas while there is unemployment in other areas.

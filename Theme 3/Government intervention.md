## An overview

### Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)
The CMA is an independent non-ministerial government department, working to promote competition and to make markets work well for consumers, businesses and the economy.
They have a few functions:
- Investigating mergers which could restrict competition.
- Conducting market studies & investigations in markets where there may be competition & consumer problems.
- Investigating where there may be breaches of UK or EU prohibitions against anti-competitive agreements & abuses of dominant market positions.
- Bringing criminal proceedings against individuals who commit the cartel offence.
- Enforcing consumer protection legislation.
- Co-operating with sector regulators & encouraging them to use their competition powers.
If there is a breach in the CMA's eyes there may be fines up to 10% of global sales revenue or imprisonment to the directors. 
CMA also stops merger acquisitions if they have a combined market share in the UK of more than 25%. 

### European commission
The european commission is responsible for investigating and punishing firms which breach EU competition law. This commission acts and affects trade across national boundaries in the EU.

## Merger control 
Mergers and takeovers between firms can lead to:
- Greater market concentration and monopoly power with loss of allocative efficiency.
- Higher prices for consumers.
- Less consumer surplus and higher producer surplus if prices and profits rise.
- Job losses through rationalisation. 
- Asset stripping and financial gains for some at the expense of others. 
- Less choice for consumers.
- A drop in quality of goods/services due to a lessening of competition.

Due to allocative inefficiency the government may wish to consider whether some mergers should not go ahead. 
However there can be more benefits for the market from a merger such as:
- It may reduce overcapacity in a market.
- Greater profit may enhance R and D leading to greater dynamic efficiency.
- Economies of scale leading to cost savings could lead to lower prices for consumers.
- UK firms may be better to compete globally.

Mergers are considered 'relevant' for referral to the CMA if:
- At least one of the firms is active in the UK
- Joint annual turnover would exceed Â£70m or
- Joint share of market supply would be 25% or more.

## Monopoly control and impact 
The CMA often has to stop other companies from buying others and causing a market dominance. Monopolies in the market are often less efficient for the market but can allow for more funds for investment and potential economies of scale for the company.

It is possible that a regulatory failure might occur, with the 'wrong' decision made for the benefit of consumers. This can happen because:
- The regulator does not have all the relevant information about possible costs and benefits.
- The regulator is influenced to act some way in the interests of one of the firms in question to the detriment of other stakeholders.
- The cost of investigations is high.
- There is significant time lag before a decision is made causing uncertainty in the market.

### Price & Profit regulation
Price controls are one of the main methods used by the UK government to regulate privatised monopolies. On privatising state-owned monopolies the UK government appointed a regulator as a **surrogate for competition** to set price and maintain quality in each industry. 

#### Price capping
A price cap is an upper limit for the price increase that a firm can add to their retail prices. The focus is on controlling price to prevent abnormal profits. 
- Price limits are set on privatised utilities using a formula linked to inflation rate, an RPI + K or RPI - X formula. 
- Price limits fixed for a set period of time ie 5 years.
- RPI - X: This formula says to remove the **efficiency gains** (x)
- RPI + K: This formula says to increase the budget for infrastructure improvements ie aging water barriers.

It is difficult for the government to know where K and X actually lie. The company may also have better information about costs than the regulator. This may result in prices being kept high as the regulator has limited information and may become a victim of regulatory capture. 
Firms may improve efficiency and look for productivity gains (reduce x-inefficiency) in order to increase profits. However the firm might achieve its productivity gains by reducing the quality of the goods or by investing less in the future.


#### Profit regulation
Another way that monopolists can be controlled is by fixing a maximum level of profit that they can earn. The government should set a level of profit such that the monopolist makes no more profit than if the industry were perfectly competitive. In practice this is the operating costs plus a rate of return.

##### Rate of return 
This regulation method allows a firm to make a certain level of profit based on their capital before the remainder of the profit is taxed at 100%

The impact of this is that firms are not rewarded for their success but instead penalised for it and encouraged to make a limited profit. 

### Quality standards & performance targets
A profit maximising monopolist is focussed on profit and not quality. A method of control is by setting quality or performance standards. Monopolists may resist the imposition and may attempt to find ways around the targets.

## Promoting competition and contestability
The different ways government intervention can help businesses:
- Enhance competition between firms through the promotion of small businesses. 
- Deregulation.
- Competitive tendering for government contracts.
- Privatisation. 






## Protecting suppliers & employees

## Limitations to government intervention

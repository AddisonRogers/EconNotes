# Production
In the short run, where one or more factor of production is fixed, output is related to the combination of land, labour and capital. To increase production you would increase a factor of an industry's inputs.

### Law of diminishing marginal returns
This law states that after a certain period of increasing the factors of production in the short run. The eventual increase in marginal output decreases before regardless of the increase in factors of production there will be no increase in output.

# Costs

| Cost type          | Definition                                                                 | Example               |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Fixed               | Costs which do not vary as the level of production increases or decreases. | Rent, Heating.        |
| Variable costs      | Costs which vary directly in proportion to the level of output of a firm.  | Raw resource ie wood. |
| Semi Variable costs | Costs that vary with output but not in direct proportion                   | Machinery, Tools                      |

| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Average (total) cost (ATC or AC) | The average cost of production per unit, calculated by dividing the total cost by the quantity produced.   |
| Marginal cost (MC)               | The cost of producing an extra unit of output or the change in total cost divided by the change in output. |
| Total Cost (TC)                  | The cost of producing any given level of output.                                                           |                                                                                                        |


# Economies and Diseconomies of scale
Over the long run all factors of production are variable.

### Economies of scale 
A fall in the long run average costs of production as output rises.

### Constant returns to scale 
Occur when a firm experiences constant long run average total costs as it expands output.

### Minimum efficient scale of production 
The lowest level of output at which long run average cost is minimised.

### Diseconomies of scale 
A rise in the long run average costs of production as output rises.

## Sources of internal economies of scale
1. Risk-baring economies of scale:
	Large firms are able to diversify into more products/markets, reducing the risk of collapse and thereby the risk to investors which may result in the demanding a lower return on capital.

2. Financial economies of scale:
	Larger firms considered more 'credit worthy', therefore banks charge lower interest rates. Larger firms have access to a wide range of possibly cheaper sources of finance.

3. Managerial economies of scale:
	Specialist managers using specialist equipment.

4. Technical economies of scale:
	1. Expensive capital inputs:
		Large-scale businesses can afford to invest in expensive and specialist machinery.
	2. Specialisation of the workforce:
		Larger firms can afford to / are able to employ more specialists who are likely to be more productive leading to cost savings
	3. The law of increased dimensions or the "container principle":
		Cubic principles.

5. Marketing economies of scale:
	Large firms are more able to afford larger, more effective advertising campaigns.

6. Purchasing economies of scale:
	Probably the best known economy of scale, large firms are more able to bulk buy goods and therefore negotiate lower unit costs.

## Sources of internal diseconomies of scale 
1. Control 
	difficult to monitor productivity & quality of output of thousand of employees.

2. Co-ordination
	Difficult to co-ordinate complicated production processes across many factories in different locations & countries, and contracts with hundreds of suppliers.

3. Co-operation 
	Workers may lack motivation, not feeling important in a big organisation, therefore productivity may fall.

4. Communication
	Difficulties - leading to poor decision making and higher costs.

You can avoid diseconomies of scale using: Human resource management, Performance related pay schemes and out-sourcing manufacturing and distribution. 


## Sources of external economies of scale 
External economies of scale: falling average costs of production, shown by a downward shift in the long run average cost curve, which results from a growth in the size of the industry within which a firm operates.

Growth of an industry within an area may lead to:
- Better local transport network.
- Lower training costs.
- Research and development facilities in local universities.
- Component suppliers and other support businesses in the area.
- Technology: LRAC assumes technology is unchanged, in the 'very' long run technology may change leading to greater efficiency.

## Sources of external diseconomies of scale 
External Diseconomies of scale: Rising average costs of production, shown by an upward shift in the long run average cost curve, which results from a growth in the size of the industry beyond its optimal size. 
It mainly occurs when an industry expands too quickly, individual firms compete with each other and bid up prices of factor inputs.

# Revenue
Revenue is the income a firm receives from selling its output.

Market structure refers to the number of competing firms on the market.
| Perfect competition                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Monopolistic competition               | Oligopoly                                                          | Monopoly                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Large numbers of buyers and sellers in perfect market knowledge able to buy and sell as much as they wish because they are unable to influence the ruling market price due to all of the products being homogeneous. | Imperfect competition amongst the many | A few mutually interdependent firms, needing to watch competition. | One firm producing 100% of market output |

| Revenue          | Description                                                            | Equation                               |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Total revenue    | The total money received from the sale of any given quantity of output | TR = price per unit x quantity sold    |
| Average revenue  | The average receipts per unit sold                                     | AR = TR/Q                              |
| Marginal revenue | The change in revenue from selling one extra unit of output.           | MR = change in TR / change in quantity |

### Price takers and price makers
A price taker is a firm which has no influence on the market price and must sell all its output at the going market price. Firms in a perfectly competitive market are price takers.
A price maker is a firm which is able to select the price a which it sells it output. It will generally sell more at a lower price. There are differing degrees of price-setting power. A monopolist has the most power to set price as its is the only firm in the market. In oligopoly and monopolistic competition firms have less price-setting power but can still raise their price without losing all their customers.

## Normal profits, supernormal profits and losses.
Profit is the total revenue - the total cost.

Costs can be financial costs (ones paid out by the firm), opportunity cost or the economic cost (financial + opportunity cost).

Normal profit is where the total revenue is equal to the total cost. 
Subnormal profit is where total revenue is less.
Supernormal is where total revenue is more.

Profit is the return to the entrepreneur for risk-taking. It is the main reason for business start-ups. Profit is necessary in a limited company to pay out dividends to shareholders to encourage them to hold shares.

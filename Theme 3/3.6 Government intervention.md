## 3.6.1 Intro

### Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)
The CMA is an independent non-ministerial government department, working to promote competition and to make markets work well for consumers, businesses and the economy.
They have a few functions:
- Investigating mergers which could restrict competition.
- Conducting market studies & investigations in markets where there may be competition & consumer problems.
- Investigating where there may be breaches of UK or EU prohibitions against anti-competitive agreements & abuses of dominant market positions.
- Bringing criminal proceedings against individuals who commit the cartel offence.
- Enforcing consumer protection legislation.
- Co-operating with sector regulators & encouraging them to use their competition powers.
If there is a breach in the CMA's eyes there may be fines up to 10% of global sales revenue or imprisonment to the directors. 
CMA also stops merger acquisitions if they have a combined market share in the UK of more than 25%. 

### European commission
The European commission is responsible for investigating and punishing firms which breach EU competition law. This commission acts and affects trade across national boundaries in the EU.

## A Merger control 
Mergers and takeovers between firms can lead to:
- Greater market concentration and monopoly power with loss of allocative efficiency.
- Higher prices for consumers.
- Less consumer surplus and higher producer surplus if prices and profits rise.
- Job losses through rationalisation. 
- Asset stripping and financial gains for some at the expense of others. 
- Less choice for consumers.
- A drop in quality of goods/services due to a lessening of competition.

Due to allocative inefficiency the government may wish to consider whether some mergers should not go ahead. 
However there can be more benefits for the market from a merger such as:
- It may reduce overcapacity in a market.
- Greater profit may enhance R and D leading to greater dynamic efficiency.
- Economies of scale leading to cost savings could lead to lower prices for consumers.
- UK firms may be better to compete globally.

Mergers are considered 'relevant' for referral to the CMA if:
- At least one of the firms is active in the UK
- Joint annual turnover would exceed Â£70m or
- Joint share of market supply would be 25% or more.

## B Monopoly control and impact 
The CMA often has to stop other companies from buying others and causing a market dominance. Monopolies in the market are often less efficient for the market but can allow for more funds for investment and potential economies of scale for the company.

It is possible that a regulatory failure might occur, with the 'wrong' decision made for the benefit of consumers. This can happen because:
- The regulator does not have all the relevant information about possible costs and benefits.
- The regulator is influenced to act some way in the interests of one of the firms in question to the detriment of other stakeholders.
- The cost of investigations is high.
- There is significant time lag before a decision is made causing uncertainty in the market.

### Price & Profit regulation
Price controls are one of the main methods used by the UK government to regulate privatised monopolies. On privatising state-owned monopolies the UK government appointed a regulator as a **surrogate for competition** to set price and maintain quality in each industry. 

#### Price capping
A price cap is an upper limit for the price increase that a firm can add to their retail prices. The focus is on controlling price to prevent abnormal profits. 
- Price limits are set on privatised utilities using a formula linked to inflation rate, an RPI + K or RPI - X formula. 
- Price limits fixed for a set period of time ie 5 years.
- RPI - X: This formula says to remove the **efficiency gains** (x)
- RPI + K: This formula says to increase the budget for infrastructure improvements ie aging water barriers.

It is difficult for the government to know where K and X actually lie. The company may also have better information about costs than the regulator. This may result in prices being kept high as the regulator has limited information and may become a victim of regulatory capture. 
Firms may improve efficiency and look for productivity gains (reduce x-inefficiency) in order to increase profits. However the firm might achieve its productivity gains by reducing the quality of the goods or by investing less in the future.

#### Profit regulation
Another way that monopolists can be controlled is by fixing a maximum level of profit that they can earn. The government should set a level of profit such that the monopolist makes no more profit than if the industry were perfectly competitive. In practice this is the operating costs plus a rate of return.

##### Rate of return 
This regulation method allows a firm to make a certain level of profit based on their capital before the remainder of the profit is taxed at 100%

The impact of this is that firms are not rewarded for their success but instead penalised for it and encouraged to make a limited profit. 

### Quality standards & performance targets
A profit maximising monopolist is focused on profit and not quality. A method of control is by setting quality or performance standards. Monopolists may resist the imposition and may attempt to find ways around the targets.

## C Promoting competition and contestability 
### Small businesses
Government intervention generally helps small businesses. This is because these businesses provide 60% of jobs and 50% of GDP in the UK. Small businesses are also more often more innovative and can challenge existing firms in an industry. The government can help these companies by:
- Lowering rate of corporation tax.
- VAT relief for small businesses.
- Act as a guarantor for bank loans.
- Encourage public sector bodies to give business to small firms.

### Deregulation 
Another benefit government can do to increase competition is by decreasing regulation. 
	This can spur competition due to greater efficiency leading to lower costs and prices. 
	Government regulation often involves excessive costs of bureaucracy.
	However it may be difficult to create effective competition in an industry which is a natural monopoly - high barriers to entry. Deregulation may create a private firm with monopoly power.
	Deregulation could lead to a compromise of public services with poorer quality provision.

### Competitive tendering for government contracts
Some services are state provided or subsidised as they are merit or public goods- private sector provision is inadequate or inequitable. State financing of these goods/services does not require state production the public sector could purchase them from private sector.
Contracting out: getting private sector firms to produce the goods and services, which are then provided by the state for its citizens.
Competitive tendering: introducing competition amongst private sector firms, which put in bids for work, which is contracted out by the public sector.

#### Public private partnerships (PPPs)
PPPs are a partnership between the public sector and the private sector where the public sector and the private sector companies collaborate to deliver services. 
- One type is partial privatisation where state retains a part share.
- Most common form in recent years has been PFI projects (Private finance initiative) where a private sector firm finances a project and collects income from it for a fixed period of time or the government leases the facility from the private company on a long lease.
PFI projects has enabled the government to gain many new public sector facilities without up-front payment and therefore avoids raising taxes or borrowing. 

### Privatisation
Arguments in favour:
- Promotion of competition.
- Cost (productive efficiency) : reduce X-inefficiency.
- Choice and quality.
- Innovation (dynamic efficiency).
- The invisible hand of the market (resource allocation)
The process of privatisation can also achieve:
- Wider share of ownership "popular capitalism".
- Reduction in public borrowing and state spending.

## D Protecting suppliers & employees 

### Restrictions on monopsony power of firms
The government is responsible to regulate the relationship between the largest buyers and their suppliers. 

### Nationalisation
Nationalisation is the transfer of firms or assets from private sector ownership to state ownership. 
- Private monopoly is assumed to maximise profit, this leads to an inefficient level of output.
- Nationalisation aims to change the goals of the firm, the industry is tasked to maximise social welfare not private profit. 

Arguments in favour of nationalisation includes:
- Lower costs (productive efficiency) from economies of scale by merging numerous previously private businesses if it is a natural monopoly, also no marketing costs.
- Better management: viewed as opportunity to appoint efficient modern management to run industries to maximise net social benefit. It is argued previous private owners sought quiet life or short run profit. 
- Control of monopolies: Easy and efficient way of controlling local monopolies. 
- Maximising of net social benefit not private profit: Where externalities argued to be present.
- Greater control of economy: for government to manage unstable market economy. 
- Fairer distribution of resources: from owners to workers / consumers. 

## 3.6.2 Limitations to government intervention
**Regulatory capture** is a situation in which the regulator of an industry ends up acting for the firm rather than regulating it and acting in the interest of consumers. Some economists argue that regulation is **not** in the public interest at all as the regulatory agencies come to be dominated by the industries being regulated over time. However this is an extreme view and it is more often slightly influenced rather than being fully captured. 

### Public interest theory 
The idea that regulatory bodies will correct market failures and operate in the interests of society follows public interest theory. This theory is regulation is supplied in response to the demand of the public for the correction of inefficient or inequitable market practices. Regulation in this situation is assumed to benefit society as a whole rather than few interests.

The characteristics of a market, which determine firms' behaviour.

| Revenue         | Description                                                            | Equation                            |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Total revenue   | The total money received from the sale of any given quantity of output | TR = price per unit x quantity sold |
| Average revenue | The average receipts per unit sold                                     | AR = TR/Q                           |
| Marginal revenue | The change in revenue from selling one extra unit of output.           | MR = change in TR / change in quantity |

There are a few characteristics for each market structure:
- Number of firms in the market.
- Barriers to entry.
- Barriers to exit.
- Homogeneous/Heterogeneous goods.
- Brand.
- Information in the market.
- Interdependency.

## Perfect competition
This is when there is many buyers and sellers the market with perfect knowledge to produce homogeneous goods with no barriers to exit or entry. 
Perfect competition is impossible due to the impossibility of these factors.
A few markets close to this are:
- Agriculture.
- Foreign exchange markets.

Implications of this model are that firms are price takers and sell as much as they wish at the ruling market price. 

## Efficiency
There are a few types of efficiency:
- Allocative efficiency is achieved when the value consumers place on a good or service equals the cost of the resources used up in production.
- Productive efficiency is achieved when the output is produced at minimum average total cost.
- Dynamic efficiency is when resources are allocated efficiently over time. 
- X-inefficiency occurs when a firm has little incentive to control costs due to large profits being earned and a lack of competition. 

## Barriers to entry
Barriers to entry are factors which make it difficult or impossible for firms to enter an industry and compete with existing producers.

## Barriers to exit
These barriers are obstacles to firms leaving the market. This is likely sunk costs or reputation damage. 

## Monopoly 
A market structure where one firm supplies *all* output in the industry without facing competition because of high barriers to entry to the industry.
A working monopoly is where a firm has a market share of 25%
A dominant monopoly is where a firm has a market share of >=40% 

Monopoly power is the ability to influence the market. 
Natural monopoly is an industry where a substantial economies of scale is required to be viable. 

### Evaluation of monopoly : Costs 
1. Loss of economic efficiency.
2. Welfare loss, higher prices and lower output.
3. Redistributive effect.
4. Less consumer choice.

### Evaluation of monopoly : Benefits
1. Possible improvement in dynamic efficiency.
    - Schumpeter and 'creative destruction'
	Schumpeter considered that monopoly leads to the development of new products as firms need to get round barriers to entry. They create products to destroy the monopoly position of existing products.
2. Global competition.
3. Economies of scale.
4. Cross-subsidisation.
	This can be used to avoid price discrimination. ie it costs more money to ship mail across the country than next door but the post office costs the same price. 

## Monopolistic competition.
A market structure where a large number of small firms produce differentiated products and where there are low barriers to entry or exit.
In this structure buyers and sellers can relatively easily leave and sell a variety of goods with perfect knowledge.

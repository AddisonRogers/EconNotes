## Monetary policy revision
### The monetary policy committee (MPC)
- The MPC meets at the bank of england. It is chaired by the Governor of the Bank. There are 9 members in total, 5 from the bank and 4 independent experts.
- The MPC meets monthly to decide on the Bank Rate and the amount of QE.
- The MPC is responsible for meeting the government's inflation target.
- The MPC publishes the minutes of its meetings (8 times a year) and if the inflation target of 2% is missed the Governor must send an open letter to the Chancellor.

### The Bank's remit and the inflation target 
- The inflation target is 2% CPI inflation. The target is announced each year in the Budget.
- Although the Bank has independence, in extreme circumstances the Government could instruct the Bank for a limited period.
- The target is not the lowest possible rate of inflation. Inflation below the target is considered to be undesirable.
- If the target is missed by more than 1% then the Governor has to write a open letter to the Chancellor.
- It is recognised that it is very unlikely that inflation will be 2% all the time. 

## Impact of changes to interest rates 
A higher UK relative interest rate (compared to other countries) will attract hot money flows into the UK to take advantage of higher interest on bank deposits. This means depositors will need to buy £s and cause a rise in the exchange rate. 

## Quantitative easing 
Quantitative easing means that the BoE electronically creates money and uses this to purchase assets in the economy. The BoE for example created £200 bn following the covid pandemic. 
This policy is used to increase aggregate demand and keep inflation at 2%. 
Typically the BoE purchases government bonds but occasionally corporation bonds. 

### How does QE work?
- Increased cash for those who sell the assets.
- Higher prices of other assets.
- Lower long-term interest rates.
- Reduced value of the £

### Evaluation of QE
- Increased growth and inflation. 
- Greater risk taking.
- Currency manipulation + Corruption.
- Decreased return on savings.
- Damage ability to borrow.

## Exchange rate systems

Intermediate exchange rate systems are the most common. Past systems included:
- The exchange rate mechanism: The pound was allowed to fluctuate but central banks were committed to intervene in foreign exchange markets and use interest rate policy to keep their domestic currency within the limits.
- The Bretton Woods agreement: Currencies were fixed to the us dollar but allowed to fluctuate in a small amount.

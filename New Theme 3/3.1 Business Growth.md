## 3.1.1 Sizes and types of firms
### Behavioural/organisational theories
An **organisational theory** is a theory that assumes a firm is a coalition of different groups such as shareholders, managers and workers. The **dominant group** can give greater emphasis to their own objectives. 

#### Managerial theory 
This assumes that firms wish to maximise managerial objectives rather than profit. 

#### The divorce of ownership and control 
Shareholders in a public limited company cannot exercise day-to-day control over the decisions of the managers. Managers meanwhile may have different objectives to owners ie job satisfaction. Management decisions may **not** therefore maximise profit or shareholder value over time. 

#### The principal agent problem
A problem arising from conflict between the objectives of the principals and those agents who take decisions on their behalf. Linked to asymmetric information. 

### Why some firms remain small
Some firms may remain small from participating in a niche market. This is a focused target-able portion of a market with a narrowly defined group of potential customers. 

## 3.1.2 Business growth
Firms can grow in two ways. 
- Organic or internal growth: A firm increases its size through investment in capital equipment or increased labour force.
- External growth: Growth through a merger or takeover.

### Merger/Takeover 
The joining together of two or more firms under common ownership. A takeover may be 'friendly' if the board of directors of the targeted company accept the bid to buy. It will become hostile if the bid is rejected and instead the company is bought via buying 50% of the (voting) shares to take control.

There are a variety of different merger types.
- Vertical: Two firms at different production stages in the same industry.
- Forward: Supplier buying the main buyer.
- Backward: Buyer buying the supplier.
- Horizontal: Two firms at the same level of production.
- Conglomerate: A merger between two firms producing unrelated products. 

Other relevant terms:
- Synergy: Who two or more activities or firms put together can create greater outcome than the sum of the individual parts.
- Asset stripping: Occurs when a predator takes over a target company because it feels that the market price of the target's assets is higher than its stock market value suggests. The assets can be stripped out individually and sold in total for more than the price the predator pays to acquire the company. 
- Shareholder value: Increasing the wealth of the shareholders by paying dividend and/or causing the share price to increase. 
- Minimum efficient scale of production: the lowest level of output at which long run average cost is minimised.

## 3.1.3 Demergers
A demerger is when a firms splits into two or more independent businesses. A demerger can happen due to a variety of reasons but the largest one is due to diseconomies of scale.
Sources of diseconomies of scale:
- **Control**: Difficult to monitor & quality of output of thousands of employees.
- **Co-ordination**: Difficult to co-ordinate complicated production processes across many factories in different locations & countries, and contracts with hundreds of suppliers. Achieving efficient flows of information in large businesses is expensive.
- **Co-operation**: Workers may lack motivation, not feeling important in a big organisation, therefore productivity may fall.
